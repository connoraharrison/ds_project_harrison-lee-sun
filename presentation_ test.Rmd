## Problem statement and background ##

- The upward trend of the cost of higher education has not been accompanied by an upward increase in incomes

- Less studies focus on the effects of the level of students loans debt has on studentsâ€™ post-graduation decision-making

- We hypothesize that high levels of student loan debt have negative effects on employment outcomes for recent graduates

## Research design and approach ##

- Dataset: National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG)

- Goals
1. Data visualization: to test any trends or relationships between variables of interest
2. Machine learning: to find the best predictor for the overall job satisfaction

## Methods / tools ##

- Data Visualization 
1. recode variables
2. create new indicators
3. group variables 
- Machine Learning
